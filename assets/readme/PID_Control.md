#### What's a PID controller

A **proportional–integral–derivative controller** (PID controller) is one of the most common control loop feedback mechanisms. A PID controller continuously calculates an **error function** (which in our case is the distance from the center of the lane) and applies a correction based on proportional (P), integral (I), and derivative (D) terms.

#### Choosing PID Parameters

The behavior of a PID controller depends on three main parameters, namely the **proportional**, **integral** and **derivative gain**. Each one of these three parameters controls the strenght of the respective controller's response. In particular:

1. **Proportional gain** regulates how large the change in the output will be for a given change in the error. If the proportional gain is too high, the system can become unstable (see *p controller* gif above).
2. **Integral gain** contributes in proportion to both the magnitude of the error and the duration of the error. In this way controller is able to eliminate the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller (*i.e.* a purely proportional controller operates only when error is non-zero) and is able to deal with systematic biases.
3. **Derivative gain** decides how much the error's rate of change is taken into account when computing the response. In other words, if the desired setpoint is getting closer (= error is decreasing) the response must be smoothed in order not to overshoot the target. Derivative component benefits the system's stability and settling time.

In the current project, parameters have been manually tuned by qualitatively inspecting the driving behaviour in the simulator in response to parameter's changes. Parameter's validation could also be easily performed automatically in a simulator in which headless mode was available.

## PID Controller

A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three term controller) is a control 
loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications 
requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error 
value (CTE in our case) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process 
variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, 
and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively) which give the controller its name.

The P, or "proportional", component had the most directly observable effect 
on the car's behavior. It causes the car to steer proportional (and opposite) 
to the car's distance from the lane center (which is the CTE) - if the car is 
far to the right it steers hard to the left, if it's slightly to the left it 
steers slightly to the right.

The I, or "Integral", component that effect setup error, for example car has 
left turn bias.

The D, or "Derivative", component that best estimate of the future trend of the 
error, based on its current rate of change. It is sometimes called "anticipatory 
control" as it is effectively seeking to reduce the effect of the error 
by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. 
The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.

#### Set Proportional Component
* Set Ki and Kd to zero, throttle to 0.1, change P so that car start to oscillate,
Higher P will more sensitive to errors which means able to handle sharp turns.
My code 0.3 makes car able to drive through the whole track.

#### Set Integral Component

Observe accumulation of integral, if integral set as zero, run 1 round it will
accumulate to > 1200.
While I increase Ki to 0.0008, the accumulation seems cancel each other on the end 
of th round.

#### Set Derivative Component
Kd will make the car drive more stable, reduce oscillate. Set Kd to 5.0 seems
make my car stable, I found the bridge part is a very good place to test Kd, 
regardless what's the entry position, by the end of the bridge the angle
should very close to 0 (car is driving straight ahead)

#### Speed Control
Based on "the more steering angle, the slower driving speed", below code will implement
this idea, if steer_value is 0, the throttle will be the maxThrottle, if steer_value
is max steer value (which is 1.0), the throttle will be 0.0

```c
double maxThrottle = 0.6;
double maxSteerValue = 1.0;
double throttle = maxThrottle - (fabs(steer_value) / maxSteerValue * maxThrottle);
```

## Result

Most of the time, the car able to driving safely between 50-60 MPH, 
while seeing a large steer angle, the car will reduce the speed to 40-50 MPH.
